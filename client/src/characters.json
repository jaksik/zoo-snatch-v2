You receive a grateful head scratch and extra breakfast. The first zoo-guest you see is a child with a Giraffe T-Shirt on. He tosses you an extra large wad of bubblegum which you catch in your mouth and happily chew. As the minty flavor explodes on your taste buds, time slows down and you realize you're choking. In your last moments of consciousness, all you remember is that damn kid and the minty flavors of death. You finally die and later become the trending meme on reddit.",

You’ve heard tales of taking the subway to a place called “Mexico” where the beaches are warm, animals roam free and the margaritas flow like wine. Before you reach the subway, you notice a forest beyond the city. Do you go to Viva Mexico or run to the nearby forest to continue your new freedom?",

You have a hard time boarding thanks to your massive Giraffe body. You manage to enter, but before you pull your head inside, the doors shut and lock your 8ft neck and head outside! A chime plays and the train rapidly starts to move. Without another moment’s memory, your head smashes into the confined tunnel. Your become rubber-necked and your head separates from your body, releasing exuberant amounts of ‘glitter’ all over and your body drops lifelessly to the ground. You’re dead!",

They resemble a certain political figure, with orange-faces and disproportionate bodies… you try to run but they pull out a knife and sing, in unison “The Wizard will love a coat made of your beautiful spotted fur!” They stab you repeatedly until Giraffe-glitter covers the yellow bricks.
